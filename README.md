#### MAIL is a single-page web application created using Django Framework.
This is email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.
Once user signs in, Inbox page of the mail client shows up.
User can click the buttons to navigate to Inbox, Sent and Archived mailboxes.
Click the “Compose” button to compose a new email.

This is single page application, with user interface controlled with JavaScript.

Client side connects to backend via APIs, to get existing e-mails assigned to user's account,
get single e-mail by its ID or create new e-mail (and send it to database).
